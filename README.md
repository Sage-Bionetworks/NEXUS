# NEXUS
Neurofibromatosis EXperiment Unification Site

---------------------------------------------
This effort, primarily funded by [NTAP](http://www.n-tap.org/), is designed to
aggregate the latest research in Neurofibromatosis.

All NEXUS data will be located on the [NEXUS Synapse
Project](http://www.synapse.org/NExUS) and code here can be used to analyze
existing data and query for new data.
